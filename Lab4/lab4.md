# Why is it important to use a license?

Using a proper license can specify the usage and limitations of a free software so that other users do not violate your intent. Freedom of copy and distribute of the free software is granted under certain licenses, but not all. By specifying the license, users will respect the will of author and obey the rules.

# Why is it important that you shouldn't use a project that does not have a explicit license?

With no or implicit licenses, the usage and limitations of the project are not specified. If you use these projects, no matter for study purpose or commercial purposes, you might get in unnecessary trouble since the author does not specify his license of distributing the project. It is not safe.

# Claim
I don't really agree. Before starting commerical use or massive application, developers should get to an agreement that everyone sticks to the one rule and everyone follows it until everyone decides to change it. Pissing developers off by not sticking to the open source rules cause forking, which slows down the development and causes spliting. 

# Linux GPL v2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)

Linus Torvalds stated himself that if the GNU kernel was available to public back in 1991, he probably would not write one of his own version. And that states his purpose of writing his own kernal as open to public and free. He wanted to name his kernal Freax, which is an allusion of "free", "freak", and "x" for Unix. It was initially licensed under GNU GPL license, which allows Linux to be reused by other computer systems licensed under the same license. However, it prohibits commercial redistribution, which sticks to Linus's intent.
